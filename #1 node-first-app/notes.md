# What is node.js?

Node.js is a Javascript runtime. A runtime is a tool that allows this language to run on a server instead of a browser. It has some new features and can't use some features from base javascript.

# Node.js' role 

Unlike PHP, with node.js you don't just write code that runs on a server. You also write the server yourself.

    1. Run Server
    Create Server & Listen to Incoming Requests
    2. Buisness Logic
    Handle Requests, Validate Input, Connect to Database
    3. Responses
    Return Responses (Rendered HTML, JSON, ...)
